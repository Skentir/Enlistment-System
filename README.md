## Learnings ##
1. It's difficult to adjust from C/Java to Python. Not used with types not being explicitly declared. Also the semicolons.
2. More issues with me accidentally writing Java code which is the issue of 90% of my errors. :joy:
3. I hate indentations and the lack of curly braces to indicate scope. :sob:
4. So many data structures, libraries, and APIs! Less lines (waow)
